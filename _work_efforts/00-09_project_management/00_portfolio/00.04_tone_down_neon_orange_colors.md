# Work Effort: Tone Down Neon/Orange Colors in Portfolio Design

## Objective
Reduce the intensity of neon/orange accent colors in the portfolio design while maintaining good design principles. The current orange is too bright/neon-like and needs to be more subdued.

## Tasks
- [x] Sync local repo with origin/main to get latest design
- [x] Identify all orange/neon color usages in the design
- [x] Create more subdued color palette alternatives
- [x] Apply toned-down colors throughout the site
- [x] Test visual hierarchy and readability
- [x] Update devlog with changes

## Progress
- Created 12/20/2025
- Synced local repo with origin/main (24 commits)
- Identified orange color usage:
  - Primary accent: `#f0883e` (bright orange)
  - Accent soft: `rgba(240, 136, 62, 0.15)`
  - Used in: logo hover, hero gradient, button borders, links, status badges, CTA buttons
- Found 9 instances of orange/neon color usage

## Color Analysis
Current orange `#f0883e` is too bright/neon-like. Need to tone down to a more subdued, professional orange that maintains warmth but reduces intensity.

## Color Changes Applied
- **Primary accent:** Changed from `#f0883e` (bright neon orange) to `#d97706` (subdued amber/orange)
- **Accent soft:** Updated rgba to match new accent color
- **Hero gradient:** Updated gradient end color from `#f7c873` to `#f59e0b` (matching subdued palette)
- **Background gradient:** Updated from `rgba(240, 136, 62, 0.08)` to `rgba(217, 119, 6, 0.15)` - increased opacity to compensate for more subdued color
- **Blue gradient:** Increased opacity from 0.05 to 0.08 for better depth

**Result:** More professional, less neon-like while maintaining warmth and visual interest. Gradient visibility improved to compensate for subdued color.

| Hero | Name, badge, avatar ring, CTA button | ✅ Professional amber |
| Projects | Links amber, status badges green | ✅ Clear hierarchy |
| About | Primary tech tags highlighted | ✅ Good emphasis |
| Contact | Email CTA amber, secondary neutral | ✅ Proper hierarchy |
| Footer | Muted gray links | ✅ Clean |

**Conclusion:** Color changes successful. More professional appearance while maintaining warmth and visual interest.
